there's three options in the script: 
- Automatic push every N seconds with random commit message
- Normal push with specific commit message (you just need to select files to track and entre the commit message and your code will be pushed)
- Push whenever you change something in the code (select the files that you want to track, change something in the code and it will be pushed)

### Features: 

- If you want to see the files that you want to track just type `/list` and a tree of files will show up in order to make things easy for you.
- If you have any suggestion please request it as a feature [here](https://github.com/0xPacman/GITscript/issues/new/choose)
